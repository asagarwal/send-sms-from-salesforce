// Class to receive SMS in Salesforce and save it as an Activity on Contact. I have kept
// this code simple as we just want to focus on how to receive SMS in Salesforce
// In an actual implmentation you would want to think about the following also
// 1. Ensure that the incoming SMSes are from an authorized system
// 2. Add error handling if the contact is not found based on the phone number
